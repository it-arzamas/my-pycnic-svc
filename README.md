# My Pycnic Microservice Starter

This is my microservice starter build with [Pycnic Framework](http://pycnic.nullism.com/). 

 * Authentication : PyJWT with client base authentication
 * Separate handler classes ( Controller )
 * Separate model classes
 * Have a CRUD base handler, so you dont need to RYS ( Repeat Your Self ) for CRUD resources
 * Config with default ConfigParser via .ini files
 * Already implement ORM with [Orator](https://orator-orm.com/)
